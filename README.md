This project is a Movie Recommender System built using unsupervised learning techniques. It leverages content-based filtering to recommend movies based on their genres, keywords, tagline, cast, and director. The system uses difflib, TfidfVectorizer, and cosine similarity to match and recommend movies.

Features
Content-Based Filtering: Recommends movies similar to the ones you like based on their content.
Similarity Calculation: Uses TfidfVectorizer to convert text data into numerical vectors and calculates the cosine similarity between these vectors to find similar movies.
Text Matching: Utilizes difflib for efficient string matching and searching.
